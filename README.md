## E-zoo-merables
_(see what I did there ðŸŽ¤ðŸ¤£)_

### Setup
* Clone this repository
* Pull up the [Ruby Enumerable Docs](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Enumerable.html)

### Choosing the Right Enumerable
So far, we have learned about `.each` and a few enumerables.  Now, we are going to practice choosing the right tool for the job.

In the `zoo_test`, you will see **6** skipped tests.  Unskip each test and try to use the *best* enumerable to solve the problem. You may (probably will) need to use the Ruby docs to learn about some âœ¨newâœ¨ enumerables!
